<h1 id="clarity-one">Clarity One</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>ClarityOne</strong> is a project focussed on develioping small but useful apps. The goal is to have clear and simple apps, which do one thing well. </p>
<p><strong><em>This is still a work-in-progress, but there are basic working prototypes of various apps available.</em></strong></p>
<p>These apps are presently designed for macOS. Though called v1, this is still very much a prototype; and the goal is to have polished versions releasing as v2 by the end of this year. </p>
<p>There is no immediate plan to develop Linux- or Windows-compatible versions, but interested users can take a stab at this if they wish. </p>
<p>A brief description of each app is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Clarity Wiki</strong> is a minimalist personal knowledge base and note-taking application designed to provide a seamless note management experience. Built on the philosophy of "do one thing well," it enables users to create and manage notes in markdown format while offering a live preview of the markdown content. The app supports a multi-wiki system, allowing users to categorize notes into different wikis for better organization. Users can easily format text using bold and italic shortcuts and navigate internal note links using double brackets (e.g., [[note]]). Clarity Wiki also includes a powerful tag management system, allowing users to filter and organize notes based on tags. Notes can be exported in HTML or PDF formats with customizable styles. Backlinks between notes are automatically detected and displayed, enabling users to track connections within their knowledge base. The app is designed with simplicity in mind, featuring a clean interface and easy-to-use toolbar for core note-taking actions like creating, editing, and searching notes.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity Explorer</strong> is a file management system for Mac users that organizes files by project views, regardless of where the files are physically stored. It is designed to simplify file organization by allowing users to create multiple projects and associate files from different locations with each project. Users can manage their projects and add files without requiring the files to be moved, ensuring a non-intrusive and flexible organization method. The app offers tag-based file filtering, making it easy to categorize and find files. Users can also search for files within specific projects or across all projects simultaneously. Files are displayed in a list view, with the option to preview various file formats like text, PDFs, DOCX, and images within the app. Double-clicking a file opens it in the default application. Clarity Explorer supports adding, editing, and managing tags for files, and it also allows for missing file management by offering options to locate or remove missing files from the project. The user interface is clean and intuitive, featuring keyboard shortcuts for common actions. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, the app provides a powerful way to manage files organized by projects.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity Editor</strong> is a distraction-free text editor for Mac, designed to provide a clean and efficient writing environment with essential formatting tools. It features a minimalist interface that allows users to focus on their writing without unnecessary distractions. The app includes basic formatting options like bold, italic, underline, alignment, bullet and numbered lists, and table insertion, all accessible through a simple toolbar. Users can easily change the font, font size, line spacing, and paragraph spacing to customize their writing experience. Clarity Editor supports saving documents in multiple formats, including HTML, Markdown, plain text, PDF, and ODT, ensuring compatibility with different workflows. The editor automatically tracks modifications, prompting users to save changes before closing or creating new documents. It also offers keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions, improving efficiency. The app is built with ease of use in mind, catering to writers, students, and professionals who require a no-frills text editor with just enough formatting power to meet their needs. Its lightweight design and straightforward functionality make Clarity Editor an ideal tool for those who value simplicity in their writing process.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity Clips</strong> is a distraction-free clipboard manager for Mac designed to help users organize and manage clipboard content efficiently. The app automatically records clipboard entries, allowing users to view, search, and manage past clipboard items. It includes functionality to add tags to specific entries, enabling easier categorization and retrieval of content. Users can copy previous entries back to the clipboard or delete items they no longer need. The app also supports exporting the clipboard history to a file for backup or external use. With a clean, intuitive interface, Clarity Clips helps users keep track of their clipboard without unnecessary complexity. The app runs in the background, accessible via the system tray, and provides keyboard shortcuts for quick access. It handles various content types, including text, HTML, PDFs, and Word documents, extracting plain text where possible. The app features a warning system when the clipboard history approaches a user-defined limit, ensuring that users can maintain control over their saved entries. Overall, Clarity Clips is designed to simplify clipboard management while maintaining a focus on clarity and ease of use.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity Calendar</strong> is a minimalist, distraction-free calendar application for Mac users, designed to help manage daily events and tasks efficiently. The app features an intuitive interface, allowing users to add, edit, or delete events and tasks, with a focus on simplicity and usability. Events can include reminders, and tasks can be given deadlines and priority levels to ensure timely completion. The calendar widget highlights days with scheduled events, giving a clear overview of upcoming commitments. Clarity Calendar supports desktop notifications for reminders, ensuring users never miss important events. The app also includes import and export functionality, allowing users to back up or transfer their event and task data easily in JSON format. With the option to manage both tasks and events from separate tabs, Clarity Calendar provides users with an organized and clean experience. The app also incorporates keyboard shortcuts for quick actions, such as adding events or tasks, and a system tray feature that checks for reminders every minute. Overall, Clarity Calendar aims to provide a seamless experience for managing daily tasks and events while maintaining a simple, distraction-free environment.</p>
