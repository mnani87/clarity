## **Introduction**

ClarityOne is a project focused on developing small, simple, and useful apps with a clear philosophy: **do one thing well**. The aim is to offer polished and efficient tools that address specific user needs without unnecessary complexity.

While these apps are designed primarily for macOS, and though they are labeled as v1, they are still in the prototype stage. The goal is to release refined versions (v2) by the end of this year. Presently, there is no plan to develop Linux or Windows versions, but interested users are welcome to contribute if they'd like.

Each app is designed with simplicity in mind and is described briefly below.

---

### **App Descriptions**

1. **Clarity Wiki**  
   A minimalist personal knowledge base and note-taking application. It allows users to create and manage notes in Markdown format, with a live preview. It supports a multi-wiki system for organizing notes, includes a powerful tag management system, and exports notes in HTML or PDF.

2. **Clarity Explorer**  
   A file management system that organizes files by project views, regardless of physical file locations. It supports file previews, tag-based file filtering, and project-specific file management.

3. **Clarity Editor**  
   A distraction-free text editor focused on writing, with essential formatting tools and support for multiple formats (HTML, Markdown, PDF, plain text, etc.). It provides a clean interface for users who value simplicity in their writing environment.

4. **Clarity Clips**  
   A clipboard manager that records clipboard entries, allowing users to search, tag, and organize clipboard history. It supports exporting the clipboard history for backup or external use.

5. **Clarity Calendar**  
   A simple, distraction-free calendar app for managing events and tasks. It supports reminders, priority levels for tasks, and export functionality in JSON format.

6. **Clarity TimeKeeper**  
   A time-tracking app that logs activities in a weekly grid layout, allowing users to monitor and optimize their daily activities. It features reporting tools for generating daily, weekly, or monthly summaries.

7. **Clarity Finances**  
   A financial management app that helps users track expenses, receipts, and memos. It provides features like customizable categories, yearly summaries, and export options in JSON and CSV formats.

## **Installation**

### **Option 1: Download the Bundled .app Versions**
You can download bundled .app versions for some of the apps directly from the ClarityOne website:

[Download .app versions](https://mnani87.github.io/mnanihome/clarityone.html)

### **Option 2: Building from Source**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
To build the apps from source, clone the repository using the following command:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/mnani87/clarity.git
\`\`\`
Navigate into the \`clarity\` directory:
\`\`\`bash
cd clarity
\`\`\`

#### **2. Set Up Virtual Environment**
It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment to avoid package conflicts:
\`\`\`bash
python3 -m venv venv
\`\`\`

Activate the virtual environment:
- On macOS/Linux:
  \`\`\`bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  \`\`\`
- On Windows:
  \`\`\`bash
  .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
  \`\`\`

#### **3. Install Dependencies**
Each app has a \`requirements.txt\` file that lists the necessary dependencies. To install dependencies for a specific app, navigate to the app folder and run the following command:
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`
Alternatively, you can manually install the required packages listed at the start of the app's Python script.

#### **4. Running the Apps**
To run any app, execute the following command (replace \`[appname]\` with the actual app name):
\`\`\`bash
python clarity_[appname].py
\`\`\`

For example, to run Clarity Wiki:
\`\`\`bash
python clarity_wiki.py
\`\`\`

#### **5. Creating .app Versions with PyInstaller**
If you want to create a standalone .app version of an app:

1. Install PyInstaller:
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   \`\`\`

2. Create a standalone .app by running:
   \`\`\`bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed clarity_[appname].py
   \`\`\`

3. The .app version will be generated in the \`dist\` folder and can be placed in your macOS Applications folder for easy access.
